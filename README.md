# react-native-hide-onkeyboard

A library for hiding or showing a view when the keyboard is present.



## Getting started üë®‚Äçüè´

To install the library, you can use either npm or yarn:

```shell

npm install react-native-hide-onkeyboard

```
or


```shell
yarn add @ react-native-hide-onkeyboard
```


## Usage
### Import 

```javascript
import { HideOnKeyboard, ShowOnKeyboard } from "react-native-hide-onkeyboard";
```
### Example
Add the component and place any views you want to hide inside. In the following example, the text view is hidden when the keyboard is opened:


```js
import { HideOnKeyboard, ShowOnKeyboard } from "react-native-hide-onkeyboard";

  <HideOnKeyboard style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', height: 100, width: 100 }}>
       
       <Text >I will hide when the key board is open</Text>

   </HideOnKeyboard>

   <ShowOnKeyboard>
        
        <Text> I will only appear when the keyboard is open</Text>
        
    </ShowOnKeyboard>

```
## Styling
You can apply styles to the components just like you would with a normal react native View component. For example:
```js
<HideOnKeyboard style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', height: 100, width: 100 }}>
    <Text style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: 20 }}>I will hide when the keyboard is open</Text>
</HideOnKeyboard>
```
